If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I’d get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I’d get high, I’d get so high
I’d get so high if I could breathe
Factors of nine, reduced over time

Chasing them primes, and counting rhymes
Facing the east, bread without yeast
Blind faith in the priests, and fear of some beast

Breaking of bread, eating the dead
Bowing my head, Gold out of Lead
Wearing the veil, seeking the grail
Wall where you wail, and musical scales

Candles are burned, incantations are learned
Ashes in urns, and prophets return
Adam and Eve, three days to grieve
Stoned if you don’t believe, only f*ck to conceive

But it’s so hard to sign my own surrender
So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I’ve defended
So hard to separate what’s blended
So hard to sign my own surrender

So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I’ve defended
So hard to separate what’s blended
If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I’d get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I’d get high, I’d get so high
I’d get so high

If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I’d get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I’d get high, I’d get so high
I’d get so high, if I could breathe
Five sided stars, buried or burnt to a char
